# Multivariable Regression Model for Residential Real Estate Valuation 
Welcome to the Multivariable Regression Model for Residential Real Estate Valuation project! This project was created as a part of a real estate development company's efforts to accurately value residential projects in Boston, Massachusetts during the 1970s. The project utilizes a multivariable regression model to estimate the price of a home based on various characteristics such as the number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and the economic status of the area.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

&emsp;• Pandas<br />
&emsp;• NumPy<br />
&emsp;• Scikit-Learn<br />
&emsp;• Plotly<br />
&emsp;• Matplotlib<br />
&emsp;• Seaborn<br />

You can install these libraries using pip or conda package manager.

## Usage
To use this model, you can simply download the project and run the Jupyter notebook `Multivariable_Regression_and_Valuation_Model_(complete).ipynb`. This notebook contains detailed explanations of the code and the model, as well as examples of how to use the model to predict the price of a home based on its characteristics.

The dataset used for this model is the Boston Housing dataset, which is included in the project files. This dataset contains information about various homes in Boston, such as the number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and the economic status of the area.

This project was created by me as a part of a real estate development company's efforts to accurately value residential projects in Boston, Massachusetts during the 1970s. The project utilizes a multivariable regression model to estimate the price of a home based on various characteristics.

The project was inspired by the Boston Housing dataset, which is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and data science. The dataset was originally published in the following paper:
